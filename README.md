# UFO's

Chandrashekhar G. Ranade

In this Challenge 11, the focus is on creating a dynamic webpage related to the data on UFO's using ,
and HTML and Bootstrap skills. The webpage was not difficult to design and produce because of the code provided in the Module 11 The following are our findings. This work is for the client of our firm, Dana.


## Table with UFO sightings for the year 2010.

The following table was produced.

This webpage has filters and one can choose a date, city, state, country, and the shape. The table also has a column which shows the duration of the sighting of the UFO, and a summary of comments from those who viewed the UFO.
The longest duration was on April 1, 2010 for about four hours near San Pablo and indeed that is a long period.

One drawback of this webpage is that the background is too dark and it is not easy read the content. Another drawback is that year for which the data are available is only 2010, which is kind of old. Now the US government has released all the past documents related to the UFO sightings and if that data are available, our work can be used for understanding that information and we will persuade Dana in that direction.

We learned the importance of the file organization system for our programs to work. We also learned about the JavaScript objects and how to work with them. This will be useful in the future work. Another important concept we learned was the Arrow Function and we will use this in our work in the future.

# Weakness of Analysis

The main weakness of the analysis is the data itself. The table focusses only on the year 2010 while the subject of UFO has been discussed for a long time. Now that the US government has released the data about the past sightings, more in depth analysis is required.
